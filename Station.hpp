 This is the interface for the Station class.
 A station is represented by its name and the trains that stop at this Station.
 Also, a station holds a vector of all the adjacent stations, which can be accessed
 directly from this station.
 The methods below are used to retrieve and modify the relevant variables and information
 about this Station.
