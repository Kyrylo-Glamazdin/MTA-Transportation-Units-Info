 This is the place to test the project and its main function for finding the shortest
 path between the two stations. In order to test the program, the following steps must
 be executed:
 1. Create an object of the PathFinder class.
 2. Read names of the stations from the input file.
 3. Read the connections between the stations from the input file.
 4. Print shortest path between the stations by calling printShortestPath function with
 the names of the stations as the parameters.
 5. Deallocate the memory.
